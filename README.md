Analysis for Pyber
# Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to improve ridesharing services for Pyber so that they can make decisions on improving/expanding their services.

# Results
The majority of drivers were in the urban areas the second most being suburban and third rural. Across all metrics except average fare per driver and average fare per ride, including total fare by city we see that Urban has the highest volume and revenue. Interestingly, the order is reversed for the average fare per driver, urban drivers bring in the lowest averafares at $16.57, suburban second at $39.50 and rural being the best at $55.49.

# Summary
My 3 recommendations are to aim hiring more drivers in rural areas, increasing rates in the urban areas and incentivise drivers to leave urban areas and take on more rides in rural areas.
